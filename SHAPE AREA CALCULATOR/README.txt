Shape Area Calculator

Description:
This Python program demonstrates the concept of inheritance and method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It defines a base class "Shape" and two derived classes "Circle" and "Rectangle".
Each shape has its own implementation of the calculate_area() method.

Features:
- Uses a parent class (Shape) as a template.
- Circle class calculates area using the formula: π × radius².
- Rectangle class calculates area using the formula: length × width.
- Demonstrates method overriding.
- Uses the Python math module for accurate π value.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
1. Save the script as shape_area.py (or any name you like).
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the script's folder.
3. Run the script:
   python shape_area.py

Example Output:
Area of circle: 12.566370614359172
Area of rectangle: 4
